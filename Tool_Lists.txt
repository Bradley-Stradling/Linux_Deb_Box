# need to check Deploy_Setup.sh writes the local source path to path file for this file after placing it in Sources.
# This will allow it to be sourced when Deploy_Tools.sh is run, rather than it being sourced in bashrc 24/7
# though an alias to quickly check what tools are installed may be nice to have, a check tools script called by an
# alias would also serve that purpose without adding sources to bashrc
# this file should house lists to names of tools as well as links to tools with commented accreditation if it is known
