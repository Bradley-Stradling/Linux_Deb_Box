# Linux_Deb_Box
Aliases and scripts for my linux bash set-up. 

Repo design to pull repo and run 1 script to set-up a box the way I want it in progress. End goal is a script that is easy to add new directories/files to with minimal effort yet robust output and creation.

Rabbits often denote an error before exiting scripts.
 (\_/)
 (*.*)
(")_(")

Todo-
Test Deploy_setup script, lots of new code added to it. Now outputs to terminal what it is doing. Error checking has been added
but no stop or exit conditions exist. Need to determine fail to exit conditions and add them. For instance checking if repo path
exists and if aliases file and scripts directory was located properly, if not error message to terminal and exit script.

Todo later. Add functions file and source it to scripts along with paths.
