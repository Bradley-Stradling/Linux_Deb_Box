# Linux_Deb_Box
Aliases and scripts for my linux bash set-up.

I set my box's up with all my scripts in one directory so they can be called wherever I am in the box.
(permissions set so only I can run these on the box)

Todo-
Portability: Set up a script to create a source file with variables for my local paths on a new box. Set up my aliases and scripts to source these paths/variables to increase portability and decrease the time it takes to get my entire set-up done after
a repo pull. 
(Trim out shorter menial scripts.)

Need to research: a functions source file and whether or not a source file full of functions can be called by scripts
and the command line to cut down on potentially exessive coding in scripts. Would also have these functions call paths 
from the above mentioned paths source.
