# Linux_Deb_Box
Aliases and scripts for my linux bash set-up. 

Repo design to pull repo and run 1 script to set-up a box the way I want it in progress.

Todo-
Portability: Finish out New_Paths.sh to prepend path.txt source file for variable for local paths. Change_Work.sh is up first on the hit list. May work as it but is untested.

Todo later. Add functions file and source it to scripts along with paths.
