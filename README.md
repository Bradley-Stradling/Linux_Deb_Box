# Linux_Deb_Box
Aliases and scripts for my linux bash set-up.

I set my box's up with all my scripts in one directory so they can be called wherever I am in the box.
(permissions set so only I can run these on the box)

Todo-
Portability: Finish out New_Paths.sh to prepend path.txt source file for variable for local paths. Change_Work.sh is up first on the hit list. May work as it but is untested.

Need to research: a functions source file and whether or not a source file full of functions can be called by scripts
and the command line to cut down on potentially exessive coding in scripts Turning shorter ones into functions. 
Would also have these functions call paths from the above mentioned paths source.
