# Linux_Deb_Box
Aliases and scripts for my linux bash set-up. 

Repo design to pull repo and run 1 script to set-up a box the way I want it in progress.

Todo-
Create new script to make a list of the scripts in My_Scripts directory in a scripts list file. may put this in with new paths.
New paths prepending the paths source to a script is not behaving, command works on terminal manually but not in New_Paths Script.
So a new script to take a list of the srcipts and prepend the paths source file to them based on a list file will need to be creatted to run on it's own after running New_Paths.

Todo later. Add functions file and source it to scripts along with paths.
