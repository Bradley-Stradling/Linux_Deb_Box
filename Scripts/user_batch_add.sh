# this will be a more involved script to add x users and set groups for each 
# and create x folders and give specific users access.
# Basically will take a list of names and flags and make new users and add 
# them to the box with proper permissions and access

#no idea when I will get around to doing it

# need to set-up source file for user add with

# username deafult_password? group x number of y flags.

# script should should iteratively allow users to be added by writing flags
# and variables 1 user per line to source 1 user at a time until
# script is flagged to create users in source file
# source files should be checked and users with details of how they'll
# be created should be cofirmed in terminal output to user
# maked back up of source file used to create users and then clean source
# file at end of script

#Enjoy the rabbit for now
